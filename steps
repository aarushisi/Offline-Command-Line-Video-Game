Implement LangChain
Use LangChain to manage conversation history, interactions, and model routing.
Set up memory to keep track of the game’s progress.
Build the Game Loop
Start the game with an introduction using the game story model.
Allow the user to input actions via text or voice.
Process the user’s actions using AI-generated responses.
If an image is used, process it via Qwen-VL to introduce a new story element.
If voice input is used, transcribe with Whisper and feed it into the game logic.
The sidekick provides guidance when asked.
Enhance Player Interaction
Implement a help command to explain gameplay.
Allow freeform exploration where the player can make decisions.
Provide an exit command to end the game.
Ensure Offline Functionality
No external API calls; everything runs locally.
Use local image processing and text-based interactions.
Objective

Create an interactive, offline command-line video game using Ollama to run small AI models locally. The game should incorporate:

-Two AI models (e.g., DeepSeek and Qwen-VL) for generating and responding to the game story.
-Whisper for voice input so users can play using speech or text.
-LangChain to manage interactions between models and handle game logic.
-A conversational sidekick who helps players decide their next move.
-Image-based inspiration, where images can influence game events.
 

Game Concept

-The game is a text-based adventure where the player explores a world filled with mystery and challenges.
-One AI model (e.g., DeepSeek) is responsible for generating the main game story and world-building.
-Another AI model (e.g., Qwen-VL) is responsible for processing image inputs and influencing the story.
-The user can ask the sidekick (a character powered by AI) for advice on what to do next or choose actions independently.
-Users can interact using text or voice input.
